	// Collection Represent Group of Object
	
	
	// Framework :  It means, we can perform some operations, and manipulation with group of objects.
	
	// Framework offers bunch of Interface, class . methods
	
	// All interface class inside of java.util packages
	
	// It is internal implementation of data structure
	
	// It provide advanced features of array.
	
	// It means Collection Framework overcome all limitations of array.
	
	// So instead of use array, we use collection framework.
	
	
	
	
	// Collection : 
	
	// Collection allow to store heterogeneous elements.  // means any combination(int,string, any combination we can use here, In array, it doesnt allow)
	// Collection allow to manipulate that group of object.
	
	
	// Collection is interface. 
	// Collection has Two types of interface
	// 1. List   (interface)
	// 2. Set    (interface)
	
	// 1. List                                                            2. Set
	// a) In List, elements(objects) are store in index wise.             a) In Set, index will not be maintained
	  
	// b) List allows to store duplicate element                          b) Set does not allow to store duplicate element
	
	// c) Insertion order will be preserved in List                       c) Insertion order will not be preserved
	
	// d) List interface contains classes ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList   d) Set interface contains HashSet(class), Sorted Set(interface)
	//                                                                       Sorted Set(interface) contains Tree Set       
	//																		 HashSet contains LinkedList(class)
